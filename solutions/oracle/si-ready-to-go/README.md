This module offers fully automated solution for deploying Oracle Single Instance 19c Database on IBM PowerVS AIX Virtual Server Instance(VSI).
## Overview

This fully automated deployable architecture creates a complete Oracle Database 19c Single Instance environment on IBM Power Virtual Server (PowerVS) with integrated PowerVS VPC landing zone infrastructure. It eliminates the need for pre-existing PowerVS workspaces and manual configuration scripts.

## Reference Architecture

<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-powervs-oracle/blob/main/images/Oracle_DA_SI_FA.svg" />

This solution deploys:

#### VPC Landing Zone Infrastructure
- **Management VSI (Bastion Host)**: Secure SSH access point with floating IP
- **Network Services VSI**: Hosts SQUID proxy, DNS forwarder, NTP server, NFS server, and Ansible execution node
- **Transit Gateway**: Connects VPC to PowerVS workspace
- **VPC Networking**: Subnets, security groups, and network ACLs
- **Optional Components**: Client-to-site VPN, IBM Cloud Monitoring, Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection

For more details refer to IBM Cloud docs [Power Virtual Server with VPC landing zone](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/powervs-vpc?topic=powervs-vpc-automation-solution-overview)

#### PowerVS Infrastructure
- **PowerVS Workspace**: Automatically created in specified zone
- **Management Network**: Private network for Oracle instance communication
- **AIX VSI**: Hosts Oracle Database 19c with configurable resources
- **Storage**: Automatic configuration for Oracle ASM or JFS2 filesystems

#### Automated Configuration
- Network services (proxy, DNS, NTP, NFS) configured via Ansible
- Oracle binaries downloaded from IBM Cloud Object Storage
- Oracle Grid Infrastructure installation (if using ASM)
- Oracle Database 19c installation and configuration
- Database creation with specified SID

## Key Features

✅ **Fully Automated**: No manual steps required after deployment
✅ **Production Ready**: Based on IBM's standard-plus-vsi reference architecture
✅ **No Pre-requisites**: Creates all infrastructure from scratch
✅ **Flexible Storage**: Supports both Oracle ASM and JFS2 filesystems
✅ **Secure**: Built-in VPN support, security groups, and compliance options
✅ **Scalable**: Configurable compute and storage resources

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Oracle Binaries

a) Create the COS bucket and upload oracle binaries.
   Please refer to [Getting started with Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage)

b) Download Oracle Binaries from [Oracle Site](https://edelivery.oracle.com/osdc/faces/SoftwareDelivery) and Release Update(RU) system patches 19.X from [Oracle MOS](https://support.oracle.com).
   - RDBMS Base software: V982583-01_193000_db.zip
   - Grid Infrastructure software: V982588-01_193000_grid.zip
   - Download the latest System Patch (Release Update) 19.X containing both grid and rdbms RU patches for AIX from My Oracle Support. Refer to this MOS note [2521164.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=2521164.1&id=2521164.1) and also refer to this [Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/ntdbi/downloading-and-installing-patch-updates.html) to understand more on Oracle patch updates.

c) Upload the Oracle binaries to IBM Cloud COS bucket. Please refer to this documentation to upload the files.
[Upload data to COS Bucket](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload)

Example json input of "COS Oracle Software Storage Configuration" deployment input for **JFS2** deployment

```
{
  "cos_bucket_name": "oracle-sw-123",
  "cos_oracle_database_sw_path": "V982583-01_193000_db.zip",
  "cos_oracle_grid_sw_path": "",
  "cos_oracle_opatch_file_path": "p6880880_190000_AIX64-5L.zip",
  "cos_oracle_ru_file_path": "p37641958_190000_AIX64-5L.zip",
  "cos_region": "us-south"
}
```
Example json input of "COS Oracle Software Storage Configuration" deployment input for **ASM** deployment
```
{
  "cos_bucket_name": "oracle-sw-123",
  "cos_oracle_database_sw_path": "V982583-01_193000_db.zip",
  "cos_oracle_grid_sw_path": "V982588-01_193000_grid.zip",

  "cos_region": "us-south"
}
```

### 2. Create COS Service Credentials
In the Cloud Object Instance, click on "Service Credentials" and click on "New Credential". Provide the "Name", set writer to the "Role" and click "Add".

Generate COS service credentials. Please refer to [COS Service Credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-credentials)

Save the output JSON for the `ibmcloud_cos_service_credentials` variable.

### 3. Deploy via IBM Cloud Catalog

a. Go to IBM Cloud dashboard and create a new project. Refer to this link for more information about [Projects](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project)

b. Go to the catalog and search for oracle. Under community registry, select tile "Oracle on IBM Power Virtual Server".

c. In "Deployable architecture setup", select the project which was created in step 1.

d. Select the Architecture variation as "Oracle Database SI-One Click"

e. Click "Configure and deploy"

f. Edit and validate the configuration:
   1.	Enter values for required input fields
   2.	Review and update the optional inputs if needed
   3.	Save the configuration
   4.	Click Validate, validation takes a few minutes
   5.	Click Deploy (Deploying the deployable architecture can take more than 2 hours. You are notified when the deployment is successful)
   6.	Review the outputs from the deployable architecture

After Deployment Oracle Single Instance 19.X Multipurpose non-CDB Database will get created on AIX and JFS2 file system is created for archivelogs. You can connect to AIX VM from VPN Gateway VM(VPC) or from gui console by resetting the root password.

## Post-Deployment

### Access the Environment

1. **SSH to Baston/Management host via Floating IP and then connect to Network services Host**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i <rsa-prvt-key> root@<access_host_or_ip>
   ```
  If you are using client-to-site vpn, you can directly login to Management Host

2. **SSH to Oracle AIX Instance**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i <rsa-prvt-key> root@<oracle_aix_instance_management_ip>
   ```

3. **Connect to Oracle Database**:
   ```bash
   su - oracle
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   ```

### Verify Installation

```sql
-- Check database status
SELECT instance_name, status FROM v$instance;

-- Check ASM diskgroups (if using ASM)
SELECT name, state, total_mb, free_mb FROM v$asm_diskgroup;

-- Check tablespaces
SELECT tablespace_name, status FROM dba_tablespaces;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Fails During Oracle Installation**
   - Check COS credentials are valid
   - Verify Oracle binaries are uploaded correctly
   - Check AIX instance has sufficient resources

2. **Cannot Access Management Host**
   - Verify `external_access_ip` includes your IP
   - Check security group rules
   - Ensure floating IP is assigned

3. **Network Services Not Working**
   - Check Transit Gateway connections
   - Verify PowerVS network configuration
   - Review Ansible execution logs

### Logs Location

- **Ansible Logs**: `/tmp/ansible-*.log` on Network Services VSI
- **Oracle Installation Logs**: `/tmp/oracle_install.log` on AIX instance
- **Terraform Logs**: Set `TF_LOG=DEBUG` for detailed output
